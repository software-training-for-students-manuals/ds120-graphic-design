<!-- 
WELCOME USER! You've reached the source code for a manual created by STS. If you plan on updating or editing this manual, then you're in the right place!

Before editing this manual, please read through the manual editing guide. It is important that we adhere to the conventions set in the guide in order to maintain quality and consistency across all manuals.

A few things to note:

* In order to have a working preview with accurate CSS and functional JavaScript, you will need a copy of the /master-files folder in the same parent directory as the folder with your manual editing files in it, e.g. if you have a folder on your desktop "STS Manuals", and you're editing the Excel 1 manual in the "excel1" folder and the Photoshop 1 folder in the "photoshop1" folder, you will need to have the "master-files" folder in "STS Manuals" as well, since the manual files link to the CSS/Javascript using relative links. Your folder will look like this: 

├STS Manuals 
├╴╴excel1
├╴╴╴╴╴images
├╴╴╴╴╴class_files
├╴╴master-files
├╴╴photoshop1
├╴╴╴╴╴images
├╴╴╴╴╴class_files


* Manuals should be arranged into Topics, which are enclosed in the <section class="topic"> tag, and followed immediately by an <h1> tag with the topic name in it, e.g.

<section class="topic">
<h1>Topic name</h1>
<p>Neat and helpful information goes here</p>
</section>

The <section class="topic"> and following <h1> element are how the manual's JavaScript automagically builds the Topics outline and creates the links, so if they are not there, the manual will be without a table of contents and its friends will probably make fun of it (which is decidedly not cool).

* Unless you are changing the contents of the <title></title> tag, you should not have to touch the <head> portion of this document (unless instructed to do so). This tag connects the HTML to the CSS and JavaScript that keep the manual functioning. Look for the comment tag that says "MAIN CONTENT", and you may edit there.


Good luck, and have fun!

            <img src="images/01-photoshop-logo.png" alt="photoshop logo">
        </div>
        <p>Adobe Photoshop is an excellent software to edit the appearance of raster images such as JPEG and PNG files. We will begin our example project by adding a Layer Mask and Adjustment Layers to edit the brightness/contrast, levels, hue/saturation, and color of our background image.</p>

        <h2>Opening a File in Photoshop</h2>
        <p>Before any editing can be accomplished, you first have to bring in an image file to Photoshop!</p>
        <ol class="instruction-list">
            <li>After opening Adobe Photoshop, go to <strong>File > Open...</strong> and find the image titled <strong>castle.jpg</strong> in the folder you downloaded</li>
            <img class="center" src="images/02-castle-open.png" alt="locating the castle.jpg file in finder">
            <li>Click <strong>Open</strong></li>

            <li>Navigate to the Layers Panel on the right side of your work station and double click on the <strong>Background</strong> layer and name it "Castle". If for any reason your Layers Panel isn't visible, from the Menu Bar, go to Windows > Layers to reveal it.</li>
            <img class="center" src="images/02-renaming-castle.gif" alt="gif showing how to rename a layer in photoshop">

            <li>From the Menu Bar, go to <strong>Image > Mode > CMYK Color</strong>. This will ensure that we are working with correct color mode for printing.</li>
            <img class="center" src="images/03-cmyk-color-mode.gif" alt="changing the color mode from RGB to CMYK">
        </ol>

        <h2>Using the Quick Selection Tool and Adding a Layer Mask</h2>
        <div class="tool-reference">
            <h1>Quick Selection Tool</h1>
            <img src="images/05-quickselection-tool-icon.png" alt="quick selection tool icon">
            <p>The Quick Selection Tool allows you to "paint" a selection using a round brush tip. This tool automatically finds the edges within an image which makes it easier to select specific areas.</p>
            <p>To adjust the size of the brush, click on either <kbd>[</kbd> to decrease and <kbd>]</kbd> to increase</p>
            <p>To deselect an area, click on <kbd>Alt</kbd>/<kbd>Option</kbd> while dragging the tool.</p>
            <p>If it doesn't appear in the Tools Panel, hold down the <strong>Magic Wand Tool</strong> to reveal the <strong>Quick Selection Tool</strong></p>
        </div>
        <ol class="instruction-list">
            <img class="center" src="images/04-quick-selection-tool-under-magicwand.png" alt="picture showing the hidden Quick Selection tool under the Magic Wand tool">
            <li>Select the <strong>Quick Selection Tool</strong> from the Tools Panel (you may have to hold down the <strong>Magic Wand Tool</strong> to reveal it)</li>

            <li>Select everything in the image except for the sky - notice how the selection expands to the edges automatically! If you accidently select part of the sky hold down <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd</kbd> while dragging over the area to <strong>deselect</strong> it. Remember to adjust the size of the brush as needed by clicking either <kbd>[</kbd> or <kbd>]</kbd></li>
            <img class="center" src="images/06-selecting-quickselection.gif" alt="using the Quick Selection tool to select everything in the castle image but the sky">

            <li>Once you have everything but the sky selected, navigate to the bottom of the Layers Panel and <strong>click on the Layer Mask button</strong> (rectangle with a circle in it) to "hide" everything not selected</li>
            <video class = "large" autoplay loop muted playsinline src="images/07-applying-layer-mask.mp4"><p>clicking the Layer Mask icon to apply one to our selection</p></video>

            <div class="tool-reference">
                <h2>Layer Mask</h2>
                <img src="images/08-layer-mask-icon.png" alt="layer mask icon from the layers panel">
                <p>A Layer Mask allows for non-destructive editing to occur to an image. We can "hide" or "reveal" certain parts of an image without making permanent changes to the original. Use the <strong>Brush Tool</strong> with a black fill on a Layer Mask to "erase" parts of an image. Switch to a white fill to bring back parts of the original image.</p>
            </div>

            <li>To adjust the edges of the selection so they're more or less defined, click on <strong>Select and Mask</strong> from the top bar and in the <strong>Properties Panel</strong> on the right side, adjust the Transparency and smooth or feather the selection as needed</li>
            <video class = "large" autoplay loop muted playsinline src="images/09-adjusting-layer-mask.mp4"><p>adjusting layer mask properties after double-clicking on it</p></video>
        </ol>

        <h2>Adding Adjustment Layers</h2>
        <p>Adjustment layers allow us to edit the colors, brightness, and contrast of our image non-destructively. Similarly to a Layer Mask, adding an Adjustment Layer will allow our original image to stay intact while the edits are made on separate layers. All of the Adjustment Layers can be found in the Menu Bar at the top under <strong>Layers > Adjustment Layer</strong> or at the bottom of the Layers Panel under the icon that looks like a circle filled in with grey and white.</p>

        <h3>Brightness/Contrast</h3>
        <p>Adjust the light and shadows in an image with this Adjustment Layer. Make dark images brighter or light images darker.</p>

        <ol class="instruction-list">
            <li>Go to <strong>Layers > Adjustment Layers > Brightness/Contrast...</strong> or click on the circle icon on the bottom of the Layers Panel and choose Brightness/Contrast...</li>
            <li>From the <strong>Properties Panel</strong> adjust the <strong>Brightness to 15 and the Contrast to 30</strong>. If this panel doesn't appear, double click on the little sun icon on the Brightness/Contrast layer</li>
            <video class = "large" autoplay="true" loop="true" muted="true" playsinline="true"><source src="images/10-adjusting-brightness-contrast.mp4" type="video/mp4">going to Layer > Layer Adjustment > Brightness/Contrast and adjusting brightness to 15 and contrast to 30</video>
        </ol>

        <h3>Levels...</h3>
        <p>This tool has the ability to correct tonal range and color balance of an image by adjusting the shadows, midtones, and highlights</p>
        <ol class="instruction-list">
            <li>Go to <strong>Layers > Adjustment Layers > Levels...</strong> or click on the circle icon on the bottom of the Layers Panel and choose Layers...</li>
            <li>From the <strong>Properties Panel</strong> adjust the shadow input level to 30, the midtone input level to 1, and the highlight input level to 240. If this panel doesn't appear, double click on the levels icon on the Levels layer</li>
            <video class = "large" autoplay="true" loop="true" muted="true" playsinline="true"><source src="images/11-adjusting-levels.mp4" type="video/mp4">going to Layer > Layer Adjustment > Levels and adjusting shadow input level to 30, midtone input level to 1, and highlight input level to 240</video>
        </ol>

        <h3>Hue/Saturation</h3>
        <p>This tool allows you to recolor your image, increase or decrease the intensity of specific colors within an image, and/or lighten or darken your image overall.</p>
        <ol class="instruction-list">
            <li>Go to <strong>Layers > Adjustment Layers > Hue/Saturation...</strong> or click on the circle icon on the bottom of the Layers Panel and choose Hue/Saturation...</li>
            <li>From the <strong>Properties Panel</strong> adjust the hue to 170 and leave the saturation and lightness at 0. If this panel doesn't appear, double click on the icon next to the eyeball on the Levels layer. Adjusting the Hue will change the overall color, which adjusting the Saturation will change the intensity of the Hue selected. Lightness will change how bright such hue and saturation appears</li>
            <video class = "large" autoplay="true" loop="true" muted="true" playsinline="true"><source src="images/12-adjusting-hue-saturation.mp4" type="video/mp4">going to Layer > Layer Adjustment > Hue/Saturation and adjusting hue to 170</video>
        </ol>

        <div class=" center good-to-know">
            <h1>Black & White</h1>
            <p>As the name suggests, this adjustment is to make your image black and white. This option is only available in the RGB Color Mode, so go to <strong>Image > Mode > RGB Color</strong> before you begin. Note that if you made any other color adjustments prior to this in CMYK mode, your image's colors will change after you change to RGB</p>
            <ol class="instruction-list">
                <li>Go to <strong>Layers > Adjustment Layers > Black & White...</strong> or click on the circle icon on the bottom of the Layers Panel and choose Black & White...</li>
                <li>From the <strong>Properties Panel</strong> adjust accordingly! If this panel doesn't appear, double click on the icon that looks like a rectangle filled with grey and white on the Black and White layer</li>
                <li>For our example project, we will NOT adjust our image to RGB and Black and White.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <h2>Saving and Exporting</h2>
        <h3>Saving as a Photoshop File (.psd)</h3>
        <p>Saving your project as a Photoshop File allows you the opportunity to come back and change or remove any layers with different edits. This file can only be opened on computers that have Adobe Photoshop installed.</p>
        <ol class="instruction-list">
            <li>Go to <strong>File > Save As...</strong></li>
            <li>Give your project an appropriate name. For this project, name it castle</li>
            <li>Specify the location (Desktop or specific folder) you would like to save it in</li>
            <li>Select "Photoshop" as the Format and make sure "Layers" is checked</li>
            <li>Click <strong>Save</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>For this example, we will use this file when transitioning into Illustrator!</p>

        <h3>Exporting as a JPEG or PNG</h3>
        <p>Exporting your Photoshop project as a JPEG or PNG allows you to share your image to everyone on the internet - even if they don't have Photoshop.</p>
        <ol class="instruction-list">
            <li>Go to <strong>File > Export... > Export As...</strong></li>
            <li>Select "JPEG" or "PNG" for the Format</li>
            <li>Click "Export All..."</li>
            <li>Give your project an appropriate name</li>
            <li>Specify the location (Desktop or specific folder) you would like to save it in</li>
            <li>Click <strong>Save</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <li>For this example, we will not save as a JPEG or PNG</li>

        <h2>Placing an Image or Project in Illustrator</h2>
        <p>The Adobe Create Cloud does a great job at allowing users to integrate projects from one software to another. By importing a Photoshop project into Illustrator rather than a raster image saved from a Photoshop project, we can be certain that any future changes made to the Photoshop project will also update in our Illustrator file.</p>

        <p>For this example we will be bringing in the <strong>castle.psd</strong> file we were working on earlier.</p>
        <ol class="instruction-list">
            <li>First <strong>zoom out</strong> (<kbd>Ctrl -</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd -</kbd>) of your artboard enough so there is a lot of grey area around it. This will make placing your image easier.</li>

            <li>Then go to <strong>File > Place</strong> (<kbd>Cmd + P</kbd>/<kbd>Ctrl + P</kbd>) and for this example, choose <strong>castle.psd</strong>. Click and drag until the image covers the entire artboard.</li>
            <p>(Don't worry if it is outside the edge of the artboard - we take care of this in the next step)</p>

        </ol>
        <p>You can also choose to place any raster image in your project if you did not edit anything in Photoshop.</p>


        <h2>Making a Clipping Mask (Cropping an Image)</h2>

        <h2>Using Image Trace to Create a Lightning Bolt</h2>
        <p>Illustrator gives you the option to vectorize a raster image such as a scanned image through the "Image Trace" option. We will place our scanned image of a hand drawn lightning bolt into Illustrator and image trace it so that we can edit it further.</p>

        <h2>Optional: Creating a Lightning Bolt Using the Shape Builder Tool</h2>
        <p>In this example we will not create the lightning bolt this way. However, if you are curious as to how to create one using Illustrator tools, here's how:</p>
        <ol class="instruction-list">
            <h3>Creating Trapezoids</h3>
            <li>
                <p>Using the <strong>Pen Tool</strong> <kbd>P</kbd>, create a trapezoid by simply clicking (without dragging) four times. On the fourth point, click the first point again to close the shape:</p>
                <video class = "large" autoplay="true" loop="true" muted="true" playsinline="true"><source src="images/39-firsttrapezoid.mp4" type="video/mp4">drawing a trapezoid with pen tool</video>

            </li>

            <li>
                <p>
                    Using the <strong>Selection Tool</strong> <kbd>V</kbd>, hold <kbd>Alt/Option</kbd> and drag to create a copy of the trapezoid shape. Resize this copy to be slightly smaller than the original:
                </p>
                <video class = "large" autoplay="true" loop="true" muted="true" playsinline="true"><source src="images/39b-secondtrapezoid.mp4" type="video/mp4">creating and resizing the second trapezoid</video>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Repeat to create a third trapezoid, making sure to resize it so that it is slighly smaller than the second trapezoid:</p>
                <video class = "large" autoplay="true" loop="true" muted="true" playsinline="true"><source src="images/39c-thirdtrapezoid.mp4" type="video/mp4">creating and resizing the third trapezoid</video>
            </li>
            <h3>Using the Shape Builder Tool</h3>
            <p>Next we'll use the Shape Builder Tool to join these three shapes into one.</p>
            <li>
                <p>Using the <strong>Selection Tool</strong> <kbd>V</kbd>, hold down <kbd>Shift</kbd> and select the three trapezoids</p>
                <video class = "large" autoplay="true" loop="true" muted="true" playsinline="true"><source src="images/39d-selectingall.mp4" type="video/mp4">selecting all the trapezoids with the selection tool</video>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select the <strong>Shape Builder Tool</strong> <kbd>Shift + M</kbd>:</p>
                <img class="center" src="images/40-ShapeBuilderTool.png" alt="shape builder tool icon">
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Using the <strong>Shape Builder Tool</strong>, drag a line through all of the internal shapes of the trapezoids. After you release the mouse, the trapezoids will be a single shape!</p>

            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Once you've joined them into a single shape, use the <strong>Direct Selection Tool</strong> <kbd>A</kbd> to click once and drag the bottom right anchor point down to create the bottom of the lightning bolt: </p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If you find your lightning bolt to be too wide, narrow, tall, or short, use the <strong>Selection Tool</strong> <kbd>V</kbd> to resize accordingly.</p>

            </li>

            <h3>Adding a Gradient Fill</h3>
            <p>Next, we're going to use a <strong>Gradient Swatch </strong> for the Fill Color to give the lightning bolt a more dynamic appearance.</p>
            <li>
                <p>Open the Swatches Panel by going to <strong>Window > Swatches</strong>.</p>
                <img src="images/44-windowsswatches.PNG" alt="Windows > Swatches">
                <p>Click the bottom left icon (that looks like books on a bookshelf) to open the <strong>Swatch Libraries</strong>:</p>
                <img class="center" src="images/44a-OpenSwatchLibrary.png" alt="swatches panel">

                <p>From the menu that appears, choose <strong>Gradients > Metals:</strong></p>
                <div class="centered-image-large">
                    <img class="center" src="images/44b-ChooseGradientSwatches.png" alt="selecting gradients > metals option">
                </div>
                <p>This will open the <strong>Metals Panel</strong>:</p>

                    <img class="center" src="images/45-GradientMetals.png" alt="metals panel">
                </div>

                <p>With the lightning bolt shape selected, choose one of the swatches to apply the gradient Ffill and change the Stroke Color to none (white square with red diagonal slash):</p>
                <img src="images/46-ApplyGradient.png" alt="applied gradient and no stroke to lightening bolt">
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Once we've applied the swatch, drag the lightning bolt onto the front cover. In the Layers Panel, move the lightning bold layer to be under the glasses layer. Resize the shape as needed with the Selection Tool <kbd>V</kbd>: </p>

        <h1>Adding Text to the Back of the Book Cover</h1>

        <h1>Saving Your Project</h1>
        <p>Once you're done with your project, the final step is to Save it as an Illustrator File and PDF file for printing. </p>
        <h2>Saving as and Illustrator File</h2>
        <p>To save as an Illustrator File, go to <strong>File > Save As...</strong> and save as <strong>Adobe Illustrator (.AI)</strong> in a location you know where to find later</p>
        <h2>Packaging a Project</h2>
        <p>If you have "Placed" images in you Illustrator project, it's smart to "Package" your project in order to keep all links to your image references in one location. Packaging creates a new folder with all of the fonts and images used in the project, making the project available to open with no broken links. Note that this type of saving is only needed when using a downloaded font or placed image.</p>
        <ol class="instruction list">
            <li>
                <p>To Package a project, go to <strong>File > Package...</strong>. If you haven't already saved it as an Illustrator File, it will prompt you to do that first before packaging.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>After saving as an Illustrator File in a specific location, a Package box will appear</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In the Package dialogue box, make sure the location you choose is one you'll be able to find later</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If they aren't already, check all the boxes under options and then click <strong>Package</strong></p>
                <img class="center" src="images/packaging.PNG" alt="Package dialogue box">
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Saving as a PDF</h2>
        <p>TO save as a PDF, simply select <strong>File > Save As</strong> and save the file as an <strong>Adobe PDF</strong> in a location you know where to find later.</p>
